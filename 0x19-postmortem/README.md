# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage - "The Great Cookie Catastrophe"

## Issue Summary:

- Duration: March 10, 2024, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM (UTC-5)
- Impact: The authentication service was down, resulting in users being unable to log in to their accounts. Approximately 75% of users were affected.
- Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the session management system caused cookies to expire prematurely, leading to failed authentication attempts.

## Timeline:

- 10:00 AM: Issue detected as a sudden spike in failed login attempts.
- 10:05 AM: Monitoring alerts triggered for high error rates in the authentication service.
- 10:10 AM: Engineers began investigating potential causes, focusing on recent changes in the session management system.
- 10:20 AM: Initial assumption made that the database server might be experiencing issues due to increased load.
- 10:30 AM: Database server checked for performance issues, but no abnormalities found.
- 10:40 AM: Escalation to the backend development team as the root cause remained unclear.
- 11:00 AM: Upon further investigation, it was discovered that session cookies were expiring prematurely due to a misconfiguration.
- 11:30 AM: Issue resolved by correcting the misconfiguration and restarting affected services.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root Cause: The session management system was misconfigured, causing session cookies to expire prematurely. This led to failed authentication attempts for users trying to log in.
- Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected, and affected services were restarted to ensure proper functioning of the authentication system.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Review and audit session management configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
- Implement automated testing for session management functionality to catch misconfigurations early.
**Tasks:**
- Conduct a comprehensive review of session management configurations.
- Implement automated tests to verify the functionality of session management systems.
- Update documentation to include best practices for session management configuration.

## Conclusion:

The "Great Cookie Catastrophe" served as a reminder of the critical importance of proper configuration management in web stack environments. Through swift investigation and resolution, the outage was contained within an hour and a half, minimizing impact on users. Moving forward, proactive measures will be taken to ensure similar misconfigurations are caught early and prevented from causing disruptions to services.
